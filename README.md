The documentation for **Mojo's Maven Plugin for GWT** is here: https://gwt-maven-plugin.github.io/gwt-maven-plugin/

**NOTICE** Exists a [new plugin][ng], a fresh start that correctly support multi-module 
projects, it is not version-bounded with GWT, support multiples GWT versions and other fixes, 
improvements and best practices. This plugin is now considered the `legacy GWT maven plugin`
(aka **mojo** GWT maven plugin) and the new one is considered the `new generation GWT maven plugin`
(aka **tbroyer** GWT maven plugin). The legacy maven plugin is still supported but it is strongly 
encouraged to use the new one in new projects.
